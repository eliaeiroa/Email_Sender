On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:
 This was really nicely formatted! You did exactly what the assignment asked you to do. The only thing that you could do
 is that during the communication with the SMTP, you didn't have to print out the DATA that the email contained. I think all he wanted to see was the messages the SMTP outputs when communicating to it. But, it was a nice visualizer though! I also liked how you put comments in the code! Just remember that if you're going to have more than one line for comments, you should use the multi line comment format. Other than that, good job!
